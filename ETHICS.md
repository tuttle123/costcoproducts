Ethical Considerations in Project Design

1. Data Privacy
   No Personal Data Stored: User input (ZIP code) is not logged or saved.
   Minimal Data Collection: Only necessary data is collected to fulfill user requests.
   Secure API Use: API keys are stored securely to protect sensitive information.
2. Transparency
   Data Sources: Uses Google Maps API for location data and web scraping from Food & Wine for product recommendations, ensuring users know where the data comes from.
3. Accuracy
   Reliable Data: Google Maps provides accurate location information, while Food & Wine offers a curated list of products.
4. Web Scraping Ethics
   Respect for Terms: Scraping is done responsibly, respecting the target site's terms of service.
   Attribution: Proper credit is given to Food & Wine for the product data.
5. Inclusivity
   The project provides localized product recommendations, making it accessible for users across the U.S.
6. Bias Mitigation
   Uses objective data for determining nearest Costco locations and reflects a curated list of products without bias.
